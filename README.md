## About
This project has been growing, and still is.
It started with just the first animation where the images stacks. Then I thought it could be a page-transition. And maybe some text. And more images... yaeh, we'll see where it ends.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## How It Works
* Aninmation-delay between pages: In the components/peopleSection/homePage/index => Img -> onClick -> setTimeout.
* Keyframes for the growth and placement of the first image.
* Gsap for the stacking of the images.
* Framer motion for the header animation.
